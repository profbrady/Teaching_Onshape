# Team Project

## Updates
P1 Detail Drawing Updates 10-24-2019 rev 1.pdf

## At a glance
- Team size: up to 4
- Number of part models: 39
- Number of assemblies: 3 (two sub-assemblies and one main assembly)

## Introduction
You will work in teams to model the parts and assemblies for a single-spindle drill slide unit. This device would be used on a machine that needs to repeatedly drill, ream, or bore a single hole in a part. The device includes  linear rails, a ball screw, and a servo motor to advance and retract the drilling spindle. The spindle assembly uses back to back angular contact bearings in the front and a single angular contact bearing in the rear that allows the spindle to operate at reasonably high speeds while handling the thrust forces involved in drilling operations. Each end of the spindle includes a lip seal to keep oil/grease in the spindle and coolant out. This drill unit design does not include the timing pulleys and belts necessary to link the spindle motor to the spindle shaft and the servo motor to the ball screw.

Machine builders regularly purchase such units and integrate them into machines. A complete machine will also require a solid base, a solid fixture to hold the part, a control system with over-travel and home limit switches, an ISO 30 tapered tool holder with a cutting tool (i.e. drill) and drawbar, machine guarding, and likely a coolant delivery system.

## Requirements
- Join a team
- The team leader will start a new document named Team X (usernames) P1 Project with your team's number and the usernames of all team members
- The document will need to be shared (keep it private) with all team members and the instructor so they have full edit, copy, comment, and export privileges
- Set the workspace units to mm and kg
- Create a comment or multiple comments in your document that indicate what parts each member is creating
- If desired, create a folder for each team member to place their part models
- Model each part from the provided sets of drawings in separate Part Studios
- Locate a feature for each part at at the origin
- Effort should be taken to orient each part such that the most descriptive view is parallel to the front plane (when in doubt regarding orientation refer to the views of the provided drawings)
- Match the dimensional/design intent provided by the detail drawing for each part
- Name each part and Part Studio to match the part name given in the BOM and on the detail drawing for that part (item or part numbers are not required in the tabs for this assignment)
- Assign each part the material shown in its drawing(s)
- Change the appearance of each part so that parts that are next to each other in assemblies are different colors and easily distinguished from the parts around them
- For each of the following similar part categories create a single part with a configuration table for each distinct part (add Name as a configured part property and make the name match the part name). Name the parts and the Part Studios to match the below categories.
- Key with 2 holes
  - 15 x 10 x 100 Key (from Main Assembly)
  - 20 x 18 x 90 Key (from Slide Plate Assembly)
- Key with 1 hole
  - Small Slide Key (from Main Assembly)
  - Medium Slide Key (from Slide Plate Assembly)
  - Anti-Rotate Key (from Spindle Assembly)
- Spindle fitting spacer
  - Front Fitting Spacer (from Spindle Assembly)
  - Rear Fitting Spacer (from Spindle Assembly)
- Cover plate
  - Lower Cover Plate - Motor (from Slide Plate Assembly)
  - Upper Cover Plate - Motor (from Slide Plate Assembly)
  - Lower Cover Plate - Servo (from Main Assembly)
  - Upper Cover Plate - Servo (from Main Assembly)
- Create three different assemblies based on the provided assembly drawing packages, naming the assembly tabs so they match the assembly name given on the drawings
  - Spindle Assembly
  - Slide Plate Assembly
  - Main Assembly
- Create comments in the document that indicate how the assembly workload is being shared among team members.
- Insert all non-modeled parts and assemblies required to create the above assemblies (see the BOM for each assembly) from...
  - Standard content
    - Screws
    - Nuts
    - Washers
  - The shared document [P1 Provided Models and Assemblies](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/99c46b52e99b2a99c4095ca6/w/83a84717b402a63ba6deb122/e/e38bacdc80d7d468af3edcc2)
    - Seals
    - Locknuts
    - Bearing assemblies
    - Servo motor assembly
    - Motor
    - Slide rail
    - Slide block assembly
    - Ball nut
- Once assembled, the spindle shaft should be able to rotate, the slide plate should be able to slide but stop at the appropriate positions, and the ball screw should rotate when the slide plate is moved (5mm of slide travel per 1 revolution)
- Check each other's work; create comments that indicate whose models each team member is going to check (not their own)
- Create a checking version for each team member called Checking Member's Name Work, i.e. Checking Jess's Work and create specific checking comments in that version for each issue that was found with that member's parts and assembly contributions
- Each member must address all of the comments that were created regarding their parts and click on the resolved checkbox for each when done (do not delete comments)
